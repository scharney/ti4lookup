# TI4 Lookup

## What is this?

TI4 Lookup is a lightweight, fast component lookup for **Twilight Imperium 4th Edition** and its expansions. Search and browse action cards, strategy cards, agendas, objectives, faction abilities, technologies, exploration cards, and more, all from a browser.

## Motivation

I wanted to make this because all of the existing solutions for component lookup are too slow. Googling "lightwave ti4" brings up a host of fan content and low-resolution pictures. My girlfriend keeps asking what the primary of Warfare is and it takes way too long for me to find something to show her. I wanted something built for speed: minimal dependencies, fast fuzzy search, and instant filtering by expansion and faction.

## Offline

A service worker precaches the app shell (HTML, JS, CSS), all CSVs, and images. Load the app once while online, then it works offline.
